Why code reusability?

-  The rising cost of building large software systems can be attributed to the fact that most of the development takes place from scratch.
   But by using the object-oriented programming methodology, large systems are built via modules that have been created earlier rather
   than by rewriting the code for the entire software from scratch.

-  The two main benefits of code reusability are:-
   1. It saves on development effort and, in turn, reduces the overall development cost of the software.
   2. It makes system maintenance easier. This is because only the new module will have to be tested for errors, not the entire program.

Object-oriented programming provides these benefits through Inheritance & Polymorphism.
