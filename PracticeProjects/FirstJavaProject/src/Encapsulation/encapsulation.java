/*
*   ENCAPSULATION
*
*   1. Restricted access to their internal details, adding to abstraction.
*   2. More robust and safe entity.
*
*       {
*           -  Private attribute is used for safety purpose.
*           -  Getter method is used for read the value of a private attribute.
*           -  Setter method is used for update the value of a private attribute.
*       };
*
*   What is Encapsulation:-
*   Encapsulation is a principal based on hiding the state of objects and restricting their access to various part of your program.
*   Encapsulation is achieved with the use of private access modifiers and the getter and setter method.
*
*   How do you create the fully encapsulated class?
*
*   1. Make all the instance variable of a class private.
*   2. Only use getter and setter methods to read and write value of the instance variables.
*
*   Advantages of Encapsulation :-
*
*   1. You can make your class read-only and write-only be declaring only getter or setter methods. This prevents other code or malicious
*      code from accessing instance variables in your class that they should not read or modify.
*   2. You can add variable logic/constraints in the setter methods, so you have full control of the data that can be assigned to the
*      instance variable.
