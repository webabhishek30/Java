*****   VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM  *****

Ques:-  What is Version Control System?
Ans:-   Version control is a system that records or keeps track of the changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall or go
        back to specific version later.

*****   Advantages of Distribution version control system   *****
        1.  Faster access
        2.  Ability to work offline
        3.  Does not rely on a single location for backups.

*****   Examples of Distribution version control system     *****
        -   Github
        -   Mercurial


*****   How git is better than Mercurial?   *****
        -   Git is faster than Mercurial for network operations such as downloading or uploading the projects file to the file servers.
        -   Git's  approach to branches are more powerful than Mercurial.
        -   Git is more powerful for larger projects.
        -   Git is one of the most widely used popular version control system in use today.
        -   Git is open source and you can create a public or private file system which can be accessible by your project team.

        How are Git and GitHub different?

        Git is a distributed version control system and a tool to manage your project source code history. Git will help you keep track
        of the different versions of your project, but it tracks those changes locally on your computer; only you can see your project
        code and all the changes and revisions made to your project code.

        GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based, Git file hosting service that enables you to upload your project code, along with its
        changes and revisions, so you can showcase/share your projects and files with others.

*****   How can different commits in Git be uniquely identified?

        Each commit is identified in Git by a unique ID, also known as SHA. Every time a commit is made in Git, that commit is assigned a
        unique ID or SHA. Using this unique ID, one commit can be distinguished from other commits.

*****   Importance of the Commit Message    *****
        -   It is important to write good commit message when you are working in your team.
        -   Commit message would help other members on your team understand what files you created or what changes you made to the file.
        -   The commit message can also be used to remind you what changes you had made with a specific commit.




*****   GIT COMMANDS    *****
        -   Configure Git
            -   git config --global user.name username
            -   git config --global user.email user_email

        -   Initializing a git repository
            -   git init    -   This command helps us in creating an empty git repository, also this command create .git repository in
                                the same directory

        -   Add file
            -   git add filename

        -   Commit file
            -   git commit -m "Message"

        -   Putting up our project on Github
            -   git remote add origin url   -   This command gathers all the committed files from your local repository.
                                            -   And Uploads them to our repository we created on github account.
                                            -   Not all files are included in the upload.
                                            -   Only new files and files that contain changes get uploaded.

        -   Push your project on github
            -   git push -u origin master   -   Git push tell git we want to upload our files and development history from the repository
                                                on our local computer to a repository hosted on github.
                                            -   -u option will tell you we want to upload the master version of our commits to a repository
                                                on github called origin
                                            -   Origin is simply an alias for your github repositories address on github.
                                            -   Github automatically linked your remote repository address to the alias origin when you installed
                                                github.
                                            -   We can change origin to whatever github repository address you would like.

        -   State of your working directory
            -   git status                  -   This command will display the state of the working directory and the staging area. In other words,
                                                it lets you see the changes that have been staged and the changes that have not been added to the
                                                staging area.

        -   Show commit details
            -   git log                     -   This command shows you the commit details. It lists out the commits made in the repository in
                                                reverse-chronological order, that is, the most recent commits show up first. It shows commits with
                                                the following details:
                                                    -   The commit ID or SHA
                                                    -   Authorâ€™s name (who made the commit)
                                                    -   Date and time
                                                    -   Commit message

        -   Add new repository to your local repository
            -   git remote add              -   Using this command, you can add a new remote repository to your local repository. To do so,
                                                you should use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is
                                                stored at. The git remote add command takes two arguments:
                                                    -   A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git (the address of the repository
                                                        on your GitHub account that you want to link your local repository to.)
                                                    -   A remote name, for example, origin (it can be any name)
