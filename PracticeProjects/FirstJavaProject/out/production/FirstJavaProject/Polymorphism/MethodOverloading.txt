Method Overloading(Static Polymorphism)

1.  Two or more functions/methods having same name and either same or different return type.
    Eg:-
        public float computFees()
        public int computFees()

2.  Two ways to overload a function:
    a. Change the number of arguments
    b. Change the datatype of arguments
    Eg:-
        public float computeFees(float fees)
        public float computeFees(int fees)
        public float computeFees(float fees, int percent)

3. Type of Static polymorphism.

Static Polymorphism

-   Also known as compile time polymorphism as the compiler is aware which version of the overloaded function is to be invoked.

Ques:-  Can you overload a constructor in Java?

Ans:-   Yes! Java supports constructor overloading. In constructor loading, we create multiple constructors with the
        same name but with different parameters types or with different no of parameters.
