difference between Scanner and BufferReader

What is the difference between scanner.hasNext() vs scanner.hasNextLine() ? 

Can we specify relative path instead of full path?

can u please explain again me the difference between bufferedreader and filereader?

can we use stringbuffer instead of string?

What does WriteString method return? How do we know if the content is written to the file?

When a BufferedReader or Scanner is reading from the file through the Java program, will there be a lock on the file during that file ? 
I mean, can I save the file outside of program while it is being read/written from the program.


what is the difference between errors and exceptions?

throws goes with method signature
throw generating own exception
